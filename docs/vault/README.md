# The vault

This directory stores documents that may otherwise be difficult to locate (finding them took a bit of effort and wait) or that have been created for the CLARIN Standards and Interoperability Committee.

Among others:

* Table of data domains and data formats for Machine Learning (and LLMs in particular), by Sasa Kolovou (Athena RC); version of March 21st, 2025 (ML_LLM Formats Table.pdf)
* Global Digital Format Registry (GDFR) data model, v. 5.0.10, retrieved from the [Internet Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20110409232812/http://www.gdfr.info/). (GDFR_data-model-5_0_10,pdf)
* GDFR Ontology, v1 (probably the latest one, from 2003; GDFR_Ontology-v1-2003-03-10.pdf)
* A paper on the GDFR Architecture, Muluwork Geremew, Sangchul Song, Joseph JaJa, "Using Scalable and Secure Web Technologies to Design a Global Digital Format Registry Prototype: Architecture, Implementation, 
and Testing"  in Proc. IS&T Archiving 2006,  2006,  pp 92-95,  https://doi.org/10.2352/issn.2168-3204.2006.3.1.art00022  (GDFR_Archiving06_final.pdf)
* Unified Digital Format Registry (UDFR) proposal -- UDFR was a short-term descendant of GFDR, running in 2011-2012; it would be nice to see if it has produced any documents (UDFR_proposal_nov2009_v4.pdf)
* GDFR Classification v. 1.0.5 -- copied from [LoC documentation](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd_explanation.shtml) and stored here redundantly, 
for the sake of completeness. It serves as the basis for the "gdfr" set of keywords used for format descriptions. (GDFR_Classification-1_0_5.pdf)

An extremely comprehensive source of documentation on the topic of formats can be found at https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/intro/resources.shtml .
